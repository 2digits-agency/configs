# Lint

`vp lint` lints code with Oxlint.

## Overview

`vp lint` is built on [Oxlint](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/linter.html), the Oxc linter. Oxlint is designed as a fast replacement for ESLint for most frontend projects and ships with built-in support for core ESLint rules and many popular community rules.

Use `vp lint` to lint your project, and `vp check` to format, lint and type-check all at once.

## Usage

```bash
vp lint
vp lint --fix
vp lint --type-aware
```

## Configuration

Put lint configuration directly in the `lint` block in `vite.config.ts` so all your configuration stays in one place. We do not recommend using `oxlint.config.ts` or `.oxlintrc.json` with Vite+.

For the upstream rule set, options, and compatibility details, see the [Oxlint docs](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/linter.html).

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite-plus';

export default defineConfig({
  lint: {
    ignorePatterns: ['dist/**'],
    options: {
      typeAware: true,
      typeCheck: true,
    },
  },
});
```

## Type-Aware Linting

We recommend enabling both `typeAware` and `typeCheck` in the `lint` block:

- `typeAware: true` enables rules that require TypeScript type information
- `typeCheck: true` enables full type checking during linting

This path is powered by [tsgolint](https://github.com/oxc-project/tsgolint) on top of the TypeScript Go toolchain. It gives Oxlint access to type information and allows type checking directly via `vp lint` and `vp check`.

## JS Plugins

If you are migrating from ESLint and still depend on a few critical JavaScript-based ESLint plugins, Oxlint has [JS plugin support](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/linter/js-plugins) that can help you keep those plugins running while you complete the migration.
